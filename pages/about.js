            Around the world, millions of children struggle with mental
            disorders that can significantly impact their academic performance.
            In developing countries, where access to specialized care is often
            limited due to economic constraints, this can be particularly
            challenging for families. That&apos;s where Educaid comes in.

            Educaid is a revolutionary app that helps children with mental
            disorders improve their academic performance. One of the key
            features of Educaid is its ability to make a preliminary diagnosis
            of many mental disorders that can affect academic performance. It&apos;s
            important to note that this diagnosis is not a definitive diagnosis,
            and it is not a replacement for a professional evaluation. However,
            it can provide valuable insights and help families and educators
            identify potential issues that may be impacting a child&apos;s academic
            performance.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2">
            Based on the results of the preliminary diagnosis, Educaid provides
            personalized academic support and resources for students, parents,
            and schools. This includes personalized learning plans, interactive
            games, and resources for parents and teachers to help support the
            child&apos;s academic journey. By offering this comprehensive support,
            Educaid aims to give children with mental disorders the best chance
            of success in school.
